# Haxe to Emscripten
Simple hello world  Haxe code. Then compile and linked to emscrpten.
But, first I would like to thanks everyone from the Haxe community for helping
resolving this.

### Procedure
* OS: Windows 7 x64
* Haxe: V4.x
* Emscripten: V1.35 and emsdk lastest version

* Install emsdk-1.35.0-full-64bit.msi (Do not update it or install latest version)
* Install emsdk.zip (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
*

For some odd reason for this to work. It need both copies of emsdk-1.35.0-full-64bit.msi and emsdk.zip 64bit version.
